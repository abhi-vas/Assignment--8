##### Project Summary
This project explored multiple regression models to predict total bike rentals using the UCI Bike Sharing dataset.Starting from a Linear Regression baseline, ensemble techniques like Bagging and Gradient Boosting were implemented to improve performance.  The Gradient Boosting Regressor significantly reduced bias, while Stacking combined multiple diverse models for optimal prediction.  The Stacking Regressor achieved the lowest RMSE of **67.04**, demonstrating the power of model diversity and meta-learning. Overall, the project highlights how ensemble methods can balance bias and variance to achieve superior predictive accuracy.
